Free (as in Freedom) Open Source Software Developer & Enthusiast

Kotlin and TypeScript

Interested in audio programming (particularly on the JVM with Kotlin), especially Linux Audio Development and other Free (as in Freedom) audio technologies such as LV2 and SFZ

If it's not Free (as in Freedom) I don't care about it

When I'm not programming, I'm either playing the keyboard or (more likely) sleeping
